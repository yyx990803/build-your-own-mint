# Build Your Own Mint

## Important Disclaimer

All this repo does is talk to Plaid/Google APIs and write tokens to your local file system. If you don't feel safe entering real bank credentials, audit the code yourself to make sure.

## Install Dependencies

This project uses Node.js. Run `npm install` in the repo root to install necessary dependencies.

## Setting up API keys

First things first - rename `.env.sample` to `.env`. Variables in this file will be loaded as environment variables. This file is ignored by Git.

### Plaid

- You will first need to sign up for [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) and apply for the development plan. You might need to wait for a day or two to get approved. It's free and limited to 100 items (i.e. banks), so it should be more than enough for your personal use.

- Once approved, fill out the following in `.env`:

  - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`
  - `PLAID_SECRET`
  - `PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY`

- Now you need to connect to your financial institutions to generate access tokens.

  Run `npm run token-plaid <account>` where `account` is an id for the bank you want to connect (it's for your personal reference, so you can name it anything). This will start a local server which you can visit in your browser and go through the authentication flow. Once you've linked the bank, its associated access token will be saved in `.env`.

  This process needs to be repeated for each bank you want to connect. Make sure to run each with a different `account` name.

- If you've done everything correctly, running `npm run test-plaid` now should log the recent transactions in your connected accounts.

### Google Sheets

> I use a Google Sheet because it's convenient. If you don't trust Google or want to build your own fancy interface, you can totally do that - but that's out of scope for this demo.

- First, create a Google Sheets spreadsheet, and save its ID in `.env` as `SHEETS_SHEET_ID`.

- Then, go to [Google Sheets API Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/nodejs), and click the "Enable the Google Sheets API" button. Follow instructions and download the credentials JSON file. Take a look at the file and fill in the following fields in `.env`:

  - `SHEETS_CLIENT_ID`
  - `SHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `SHEETS_REDIRECT_URI` (use the first item in `redirect_uri`)

- Run `npm run token-sheets`. This will prompt for auth and save the token in `.env`.

- Now run `npm run test-sheets`. You should see your sheet's cell A1 with "It worked!".

## Transform your Data

- With the APIs sorted out, now it's time to connect them. Open `lib/transform.js` - this is where you can write your own logic to map incoming transactions to cell updates. How to structure the spreadsheet to use that data is up to you.

- By default, the transaction date range is from the beginning of last month to now. You can adjust this in `lib/fetch.js`.

- Once you've setup your own transform logic, run `node index.js`. If everything works, your spreadsheet should have been updated.

- This repo only handles transactions, but it should be pretty straightforward to add balances. (logic for fetching balances is in `fetch.js` already)

## Automate the Updates

The repo contains a [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) config file which runs the update every day at 5AM UTC (midnight US Eastern time). You can adjust the cron config to tweak the time/frequency of the updates. Note that your local `.env` is not checked into the repo, so you will need to copy all those env variables into your CircleCI project settings. You can call `node scripts/syncEnv.js` to automate that. 

This is totally optional if you don't trust CI with your tokens. Just run it manually when you want to update things.
